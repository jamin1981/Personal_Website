# Ben Aspill Portfolio Website - Guide

## Core Identity (from Career Coaching Session)

### The Through-Line
**Human empowerment and elevation** - whether through preserving traditional wisdom or leveraging modern technology.

You're not scattered - you have one clear thread:
- Indigenous work: Empower healers, preserve wisdom, elevate communities
- AI work: Help people use AI to *increase* their capabilities, not diminish them
- Problem solving: Identify pain points, create solutions that elevate people

### Positioning
- **Headline**: "Transformation Leader"
- **Subline**: "Turning complexity into clarity. Amplifying human capability."
- **Core pillars**: Change & Transformation, Problem Solving, AI & Innovation, Strategic Delivery

### Target Audiences
1. **Internal visibility** - People from your organisation
2. **Potential employers** - Show expertise in change, innovation, problem solving, thought leadership, strategic thinking, AI
3. **Personal record** - Log of AI projects, tinkering, explorations

### Key Tension (Resolved)
Tech/AI leadership vs. Indigenous community work are NOT contradictions - they're the same impulse (human empowerment) applied to different contexts. Kunta Bo Foundation stays visible but isn't the lead positioning.
